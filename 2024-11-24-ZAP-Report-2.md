## Alert Detail



### [ Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10038/)



##### Medium (High)

### Description

Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page â€” covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.

* URL: https://localhost:8000/
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``

Instances: 1

### Solution

Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.

#### WASC Id: 15

#### Source ID: 3

### [ Strict-Transport-Security Header Not Set ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10035/)



##### Low (High)

### Description

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy mechanism whereby a web server declares that complying user agents (such as a web browser) are to interact with it using only secure HTTPS connections (i.e. HTTP layered over TLS/SSL). HSTS is an IETF standards track protocol and is specified in RFC 6797.

* URL: https://localhost:8000/
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: https://localhost:8000/static/styles.css
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: https://localhost:8000/zapCallBackUrl/-127188932436797577/inject.js
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``

Instances: 3

### Solution

Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to enforce Strict-Transport-Security.

#### CWE Id: [ 319 ](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html)


#### WASC Id: 15

#### Source ID: 3

### [ Authentication Request Identified ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10111/)



##### Informational (High)

### Description

The given request has been identified as an authentication request. The 'Other Info' field contains a set of key=value lines which identify any relevant fields. If the request is in a context which has an Authentication Method set to "Auto-Detect" then this rule will change the authentication to match the request identified.

* URL: http://localhost:8000/login
  * Method: `POST`
  * Parameter: `username`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `password`
  * Other Info: `userParam=username
userValue=foo-bar@example.com
passwordParam=password
referer=http://localhost:8000/login`

Instances: 1

### Solution

This is an informational alert rather than a vulnerability and so there is nothing to fix.

### [ Information Disclosure - Suspicious Comments ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10027/)



##### Informational (Low)

### Description

The response appears to contain suspicious comments which may help an attacker. Note: Matches made within script blocks or files are against the entire content not only comments.

* URL: https://localhost:8000/zapCallBackUrl/-127188932436797577/inject.js
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `Todo`
  * Other Info: `The following pattern was used: \bTODO\b and was detected 3 times, the first in the element starting with: "		// Todo: is this too hacky?", see evidence field for the suspicious comment/snippet.`
* URL: https://localhost:8000/zapCallBackUrl/-127188932436797577/inject.js
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `user`
  * Other Info: `The following pattern was used: \bUSER\b and was detected in the element starting with: "		const sandbox = 'allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-top-na", see evidence field for the suspicious comment/snippet.`

Instances: 2

### Solution

Remove all comments that return information that may help an attacker and fix any underlying problems they refer to.

### [ Re-examine Cache-control Directives ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10015/)



##### Informational (Low)

### Description

The cache-control header has not been set properly or is missing, allowing the browser and proxies to cache content. For static assets like css, js, or image files this might be intended, however, the resources should be reviewed to ensure that no sensitive content will be cached.

* URL: https://localhost:8000/
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `cache-control`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `no-cache, no-store`
  * Other Info: ``

Instances: 1

### Solution

For secure content, ensure the cache-control HTTP header is set with "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate". If an asset should be cached consider setting the directives "public, max-age, immutable".
